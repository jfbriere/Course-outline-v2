\entry{Course \mbox{competencies}}
{This course will allow the student to fully achieve the competency:

OOUV: To analyze different physical situations and phenomena of interest to engineers and scientists using the fundamental laws of mechanics and to use computers to model various phenomena and to gather data in pertinent experiments.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To analyze a wide variety of rotational phenomena using the concepts of dynamics and energy 
\item To analyze problems in fluid statics and dynamics
\item To analyze problems in static equilibrium in two- and three-dimensions.
\item To analyze the behavior of materials under tensile and compressive loads.
\item To analyze and solve problems involving beams under a variety of loading conditions
\item To analyze the internal stresses and strains in beams under a variety of loading conditions.
\item To gain enhanced proficiency in the use of computers in a scientific context.
\end{enumerate}
\smallskip
This course also contributes to the partial achievement the competency:

OOUU:	To apply what the students have learned to one or more subjects in the sciences.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To identify the scientific aspects of a given topic from an interdisciplinary perspective
\item To transfer what they have learned to situations requiring the contribution of more than one discipline
\item To apply systematically an experimental method
\item To solve problems
\item To use data processing technologies	
\item To reason with rigor
\item To communicate clearly and precisely
\item To show evidence of independent learning in the choice of documentation or laboratory instruments
\item To work as members of a team
\item To make connections between science, technology and the evolution of society
\item To identify the underlying values underlying their treatment of a topic
\item To place scientific concepts used in a historical context
\item To show attitudes appropriate for scientific work 
\item To apply acquired knowledge and skills to new situations
\end{enumerate}
