\entry{Course \mbox{competencies}}
{This course will allow the student to fully achieve the competency:

OOUT:  Analyze various situations or phenomena associated with waves, optics and modern physics using basic principles.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Apply the basic principles of physics to the description of vibrations and waves and their transmission.
\item Apply the laws of geometric optics.
\item Apply the characteristics of waves to light phenomena.
\item Analyze a number of situations using concepts of modern physics.
\item Verify experimentally a number of laws and principles associated with waves, optics and modern physics.
\end{enumerate}

%\smallskip
%This course also contributes to the partial achievement the competency:
%
%OOUU:	To apply what the students have learned to one or more subjects in the sciences.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item To identify the scientific aspects of a given topic from an interdisciplinary perspective
%\item To transfer what they have learned to situations requiring the contribution of more than one discipline
%\item To apply systematically an experimental method
%\item To solve problems
%\item To use data processing technologies
%\item To reason with rigor
%\item To communicate clearly and precisely
%\item To show evidence of independent learning in the choice of documentation or laboratory instruments
%\item To work as members of a team
%\item To make connections between science, technology and the evolution of society
%\item To identify the underlying values underlying their treatment of a topic
