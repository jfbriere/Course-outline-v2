\entry{Policy on \mbox{religious} \mbox{observance}}{Students who intend to observe religious holidays must inform their teachers, in writing,  within the first two weeks of the semester as prescribed in the ISEP Policy on Religious Observances. (ISEP, Section IV D). This includes any religious holidays that occur during the final exam period. Please refer to the academic calendar for the exact dates. Forms for this purpose are available from your teacher. Your teacher will inform you of any modifications to planned course activities resulting from the teacher's own religious commitments.  }
